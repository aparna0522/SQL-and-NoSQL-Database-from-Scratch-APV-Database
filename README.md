# APV-Database
Architected and implemented a SQL and NoSQL database, while providing a CLI to run queries using a newly devised query language to interact and retrieve results.

## Key Features of the project:
1. Loads and processes huge datasets (where number of rows >>> number of columns) in optimal memory allocations. \
For instance: Consider a file of size 750kB, and the table having 20 columns and about 10k rows. If we consider there are 50 rows in every chunk, and every value of has size of 8Bytes, so two input files, and one output file would in all take 3 * 20 * 50 * 8 Bytes = 24000 Bytes = 24 kilobytes. Thus, (24/750) kilobytes would be about 3%. This means that for a file as huge as 750 kB, only 3% data would be loaded into main memory at the same time for processing.
2. Enables CLI support for relational as well as nosql database. Type chdb in the terminal to change the database type from sql to nosql and viceversa.
3. Provides cross-platform support for Mac, Linux and Windows OS
4. Uses BTree for Relational Database Structure, enabling faster query retrieval (search). Uses external merge sort algorithm to order huge amounts of data with limited memory allocations. NoSQL databases use dyanmic hashing with linear probing and chaining to make query search faster and more efficient.

## How to run this project?

MacOS (Linux): 
```
brew install rlwrap
./init.sh
rlwrap python3 cli.py
```
Note: rlwrap is a 'readline wrapper', a small utility that uses the GNU Readline library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any command. rlwrap is an optional utility. 

Windows: ```python cli.py```

## Folder/File Descriptions
- cli.py: 
    Python file to run the SQL and NoSQL Commands of our query language and get the output. 
- config.json:
    Configuartion variables to run the nosql_src.py file
- init.sh
    Initial Setup to build the project
- nosql_src.py:
    Python code for the nosql database system. Contains functions for CRUD operations on NoSQL database and external calls to PageManager.exe (PageManager.o - depending on the OS) to carry out operations like Joining, Aggregation, Grouping, Ordering.
- sql_workspace:
  - RelationalDBAPI.exe (RelationalDB.o - depending on the OS): Executable for running the relational database queries on the CLI.
  - On executing the program: (New Folders created)
    - databases:
      Folder to store all the databases being created in relational SQL. Contains separate folders for every attribute in the schema of the table. Every table has a meta file, storing the schema of the entire table, and the constraints (primary key) for the given table. 
    - temp:
      Folder that helps in processing the queries, and deletes the contents after the execution of the query. Operations like join, ordering, group by, search results, etc. use this folder to save the system's results, before printing it to the terminal. On print, these files and folders get deleted and are inaccessible to the end user. All the data is divided in chunks, and the program loads the chunks into the memory, thus helping in storing and fast retreival of the tables, joining, ordering tables, with data as huge as 20000-40000 entries per table.
- sql_src:
  - attributes.h: 
    Header file that has BTree Node, functions to operate on this node, and perform CRUD operations, range search, etc. All Nodes are internally saved as files on the disk and retrieved if required, helping in reduced memory usage for huge files.
  - table.h: 
    Header file that helps in table operations like creation, deletion, contains helper functions for insertion, deletion of entries, searches, joins, groupby, etc.
  - common.h
    Configuartion variables to run the relational database.
  - pages.h
    Processing and enable printing of queries outputs for joins, aggregations, group by and ordering. This is used by both SQL and NoSQL database design for operations on the database. 
  - relationalAPI.cpp
    APIs to enable cli.py to call the cpp functions from python. 
  - extras:
    - menuBasedCLI.cpp: Allows to independently run relational database using this as the main.cpp file. 
    - PageManager.cpp: cpp file using pages.h interally as its header file, provides an API interface for python to execute temp folder processings
- resources: 
  databases used to show the syntax for the Query language (below):
  - SQL: (Games)
    - attendance.csv 
    - games.csv
    - standings.csv
  - NoSQL: (Country)
    - country-by-abbreviation.json
    - country-by-continent.json
    - country-by-currency-name.json
    - country-by-currency-code.json

## Future Scope: 
#### SQL:
1. Use pointers in BTree representation, to include NULL values.
2. Implement functionality for the where clauses such as: IN, LIKE, AND, OR, and Nested Queries.
3. Use the Hash Partitioning or Sort-Merge Join algorithm for Joining two or more tables.
4. Chunk based processing using SIMD operations for all the operations.
5. Using templates to reduce the code duplication - Refactoring. 

#### NoSQL:
1. Implement resizing of the hash when entries are deleted.
2. Implement functionalities for the where clauses such as LIKE, AND, OR, Range Queries(<,>,<=,>=) and Nested Queries.
3. Prettify the JSON Output that is printed on the terminal.

#### CLI:
1. Add auto-complete functionality on hitting the tab on the Keyboard.
2. Enable nested query execution.
3. Create "Views" and save the intermediate table result.
